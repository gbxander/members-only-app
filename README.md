# Sailchimp Club

A Redditish platform with a twist. Users can create an account and begin writing posts for all to see. Registered users can eventually join the exclusive Sailchimp Club to gain access to special member privileges. Exclusive clubhouse members can write anonymous posts and only members inside the club are privy to authorship information. Secret password is required to join!
